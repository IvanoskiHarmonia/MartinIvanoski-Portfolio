## Introduction

This portfolio is a comprehensive display of my journey and achievements in software development. It's designed to provide a clear and interactive insight into my capabilities, interests, and continuous learning path.

## Technologies

Here are the main technologies I've worked with:

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Projects

Each project in my portfolio is a testament to my commitment to learning and excellence. I've worked on a variety of projects, including:

- SprintStudy: A web application that helps students study for their exams by creating a study plan and tracking their progress. It's built with React, and Spring.
- Bookstore-API: A RESTful API for a bookstore. It's built with Spring, and H2 Database.

Both of these projects are free to use in any settings. Feel free to check them out and use them as you wish!

## Forking

If you find my work inspiring and would like to use it as a template for your own portfolio, I'm glad! I only ask that you give proper credit by linking back to my GitHub repository. It's all about sharing and growing together!

## Design

The design elements including color themes and layouts are chosen to create a user-friendly and appealing experience.

- Stary Night Theme: The dark theme is inspired by the night sky and the stars. It's designed to be easy on the eyes and create a sense of calmness.
- Color Palette: The color palette is chosen to create a sense of harmony and balance. The colors are soft and easy on the eyes, while the contrast is high enough to create a clear distinction between elements.
